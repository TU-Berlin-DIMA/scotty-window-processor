# Out-of-order Architecture Document - Allowed Lateness Implementation
This document describes the current implementation of processing out-of-order tuples with regard to the allowed lateness in Scotty and the desired future state.
Test cases are implemented in the [OutOfOrderDemo class](OutOfOrderDemo.java).

**Allowed lateness** specifies how long a system stores window aggregates.
In Scotty, maxLateness is default 1000, but can be set to an arbitrary value.

## Goal:
- When an out-of-order tuple arrives after the watermark but in the allowed lateness arrives, Scotty outputs the updated window aggregates with the next watermark

## Current state:
- When tuple in allowed lateness arrives, it is processed and added to the correct slice
- It depends on the type of window, how updated window aggregates are output:

### Context-free windows
- Workaround: Function setResendWindowsInAllowedLateness in SlicingWindowOperator can be set to true
- Scotty returns all windows from allowed lateness until lastWatermark again, **if** a tuple in allowed lateness has arrived, and, as always, returns all windows between lastWatermark and currentWatermark 
- Problem: all window results from allowed lateness until lastWatermark are returned
&rarr; e.g., for tumbling and sliding windows ,many windows are triggered and their results are output again even though they did not change, which leads to performance issues
- only the windows which were affected by the out-of-order tuple in the allowed lateness and have changes in their aggregation result should be output again
- see test case tupleInAllowedLatenessTest

### Context-aware windows - Example session window
- With out-of-order tuple, session can be just updated (insert new tuple), session can be changed (extended, split, or merged with other session), or new session can be added (last case was fixed together with out-of-order bug PR #45, see out-of-order test cases in SessionWindowOperatorTest) 
- currently, it works when a new session is added, i.e., an out-of-order tuple in allowed lateness arrives that creates a new session window (in Scotty see tupleInAllowedLatenessTestAddSession)
&rarr; because a new activeWindow is created and this is then returned whether or not it is between lastWatermark and currentWatermark 
&rarr; only returns the added window, exactly the target behaviour
- Problem: in triggerWindows, all windows stored in windowContext are returned & then are removed from windowContext
&rarr; when session is updated/extended/split/merged, session is already removed from windowContext (see SessionWindow implementation triggerWindows) and can not be correctly updated
- windowContext has to keep all windows in allowed lateness to enable changes, and should only be triggered when they changed due to an out-of-order tuple in allowed lateness
- see tests tupleInAllowedLatenessTestUpdateSession and tupleInAllowedLatenessTestChangeSession

## Todo: 
- add logic that returns only window aggregations that have been updated due to tuple in allowed lateness
- Need to know: which windows were updated/changed?
- time-based tumbling or sliding window: only the window(s) to which the tuple in allowed lateness belongs
&rarr; just trigger these windows again
- count-based tumbling or sliding window: all changed windows 
&rarr; need to know which windows were changed
- complex for context-aware windows: allowed lateness tuple might change multiple windows 
&rarr; windowContext has to keep all windows in allowed lateness to enable changes of windows, and needs some indication whether window has been changed in allowed lateness and whether is has to be output again
